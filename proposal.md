# Library-Catalog

## Project Description 
Using the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books), I plan to create **NAME**, a virtual library catalogue. User's will be able to access a listing of books available through Google's API and render information about each book. I also plan to curate different book lists, covering different topics.

## User Stories
As a user, I will be able to:
1. see a randomized list of published books
2. access information on each book such as author, page number, published date, etc. 
3. access a list of all books published under a particular name
4. find a curated list of books

In forthcoming iterations, I will be able to:
1. create a profile that tracks my books
2. create shelves like: books currently reading and favorite books
